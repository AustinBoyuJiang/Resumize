         "description":"🎯 As part of the 2023 UBC STEM Leadership program, our team of 6 high school students was tasked with a sustainable design challenge. The goal was to create a project that promotes sustainability in engineering following one or more of the 17 UN Sustainable Development goals.\n💡 The product we proposed was a scalable, zero-electricity, low-cost water-filtration bottle, which we called Vita. With this project, we aimed to help indigenous communities living in rural areas of British Columbia access safe drinking water from lakes and rivers, which due to colonial and historical reasons, remain polluted and under boil-water advisories. With our help, we strive to alleviate the indigenous water crisis, and moreover, we hope to help a wider group of low-income communities access clean drinking water, while reducing plastic waste in single-use water bottles and promoting environmental sustainability.\n🛠️ Vita consists of several compartments: the outer chamber, the inner chamber connected to a filter, and the cap, and it works similar to a piston. First, you would fill the outer cylinder with unclean water, then you would attach the inner chamber and press down on it. The pressure forces the water to flow through the semi-permeable filter, trapping impurities at the bottom of the outer bottle, while clean water passes and fills the inner bottle. For convenience, we also designed a threaded cap that allows users to remove the inner chamber and retain clean water. The entire process takes around 20 seconds: (demonstration below). Our product could be lifesaving for hikers trapped on mountains, or reserves far from a clean water supply\n✔️ Within 3 months, we created a fully functional prototype, a poster board, and our website to document our journey and collective experiences.\n🏆 Our team presented at the STEM LP Gala and has plans to continue working on this project in the future.",

         "title":"Nail Braille",
         "description":"🎯 The challenge for SHAD 2022 was to create a product that improves the wellness of Canadians. With this goal in mind, my group and I created a braille learning device focused on helping those who are transitioning from sight to blindness. \n💡 The product we proposed uses speech-to-text to listen for words. Our algorithm will then translate the sound into English, then into braille. Using a series of commands, pins on a board will pop up and down to spell the word in braille. The user then could physically feel the pins, learning what they have said in braille. Our product ensures that learning braille can be done independently, and because the device is small, lightweight, and portable, it can be used in a variety of situations. It would also be much cheaper and more accessible than any other current market competitors, for example, a braille tutor or a braille book.\n🛠️ Our prototype was created to test the feasibility of using speech-to-text to control the braille pins. Instead of using actual braille pins, we used LED lights which would eventually turn into pins controlled by pistons. By using a computer to run Mozilla's open-source Deepspeech engine and an Arduino controlling LED lights, we were able to demonstrate that our concept was not only attainable, but practical and marketable.\n✔️ Within the month, we created a fully functional MVP prototype, business plan, and a successful pitch, which we presented to a panel of judges. \n🏆 Our team won the SHAD Western Best Prototype award and has plans to continue working on this project via grants in the future.",
